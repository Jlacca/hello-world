        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>I was born in downtown Chicago and grew up in Naperville. I attended Benet Academy. My parents both work in technology for two different banks. I have a sister who is two years older than me who is studying Athletic Training at the University of Alabama. I have a Goldendoodle named Comet who brings great joy to our family. My major is Aviation Flight and I very recently passed my Private Pilot exam. I am minoring in Unmanned Aircraft Systems so I have a possible back-up plan and this course is a requirement for that minor.</p>
        <h4>What I hope to Learn in this Course</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>Gain expertise in file management/directories</li>
                    <li>Feel comfortable installing and un-installing software</li>
                    <li>Enhance the basic coding skills I learned my high school engineering class</li>
                    <li>Gain general knowledge about many computer science topics so I can determine what classes/topics I might want to learn more about in the coming years</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h4>
            <p>I spend most of my free time watching videos and playing video games that revolve around World War II.My favorites games are War of Warships and War Thunder. I move from YouTube video to video as recommendations are presented to explore new topics.</p>
        <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
            <p>I have been a hockey goalie since I was five years old and this is my first year not to play.</p>
